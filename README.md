# Google-Glass-Pulse
This project is a Google Glass application (Glassware) that streams video captured by the camera to an ffserver over http.
It then has another server which can display the video and perform Eulerian magnification in order to attain a person's heartrate.
This data is then sent back to the google glass with another java program.
